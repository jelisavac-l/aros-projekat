        <p>
            It's a sleepless night, she's calling your name,<br>
            It's a lonely ride, I know how you want her.<br>
            Again and again you're chasin' a dream, yeah,<br>
            But Johnny my friend, she's not what she seems.<br>
            <br>
            Johnny B., how much there is to see,<br>
            Just open your eyes and listen to me.<br>
            Straight ahead, a green light turns to red,<br>
            Oh, why can't you see, oh, Johnny B.?<br>
            <br>
            And when you drive her home, is she sittin' real close?<br>
            Does she make you weak? Well, that's the way that she wants you.<br>
            You're strung out again, she's taken you over,<br>
            You've been here before, why can't you let go?<br>
            <br>
            Johnny B., how much there is to see,<br>
            Just open your eyes and listen to me.<br>
            Straight ahead, a green light turns to red,<br>
            Oh, why can't you see, oh, Johnny B.?<br>
            <br>
            And when she calls your name, my sweet Johnny B.,<br>
            You can drive all night and you know she'll be waiting,<br>
            To love you again, her kiss is her poison,<br>
            Forever inside you, wherever you go.<br>
            <br>
            Johnny B., how much there is to see,<br>
            Just open your eyes and listen to me.<br>
            Straight ahead, a green light turns to red,<br>
            Oh, why can't you see, oh, Johnny B.?<br>
            <br>
            Johnny B., how much there is to see,<br>
            Just open your eyes and listen to me.<br>
            Straight ahead, a green light turns to red,<br>
            Oh, why can't you see, oh, Johnny B.?<br>
            <br>
            Oh, can't you see, oh, Johnny B.?<br>
            Oh, can't you see?<br>
